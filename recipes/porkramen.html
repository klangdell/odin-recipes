        <h2>Spicy Ramen Noodles</h2>
        <p>This dish I came up with on my own, inspired by all of the ramen noodle cooking videos I have seen on TikTok.</p>
        <p>It's spicy but not too spicy. It's filled with a lot of umami flavors and comforting</p>

        <h1> <strength>Ingredients</strength></h1>

        <p>For the broth you will need</p>
        <ul> 2 tbsp fried chili flakes in oil</ul>
        <ul> 1 1/2 tsp sesame seed oil</ul>
        <ul> 1 tbsp red curry paste</ul>
        <ul> 1 carton beef bone broth</ul>
        <ul> 1 1/2tsp organic miso</ul>
        <ul> 1 tsp garlic paste</ul>
        <ul> 10 drops of fish sauce</ul>

        <p> produce needed</p>
        <ul> shitake mushrooms fresh or freeze dried</ul>

        <ul> bamboo shoot</ul>
        <ul> fresh ginger root</ul>
        <ul>wheat ramen noodles</ul>

        <ol>Step 1: Add your sesame seed oil and chili flake oil in a large wok. If you dont have a wok, a pan is fine</ol>
        <ol>Stir until combined, then add your curry paste. Let cook for about 2 minutes</ol>
        <ol>Step 2: Add the beef bone broth, fish sauce, miso and garlic paste. At this step, shred up about half a teaspoon of your fresh ginger</ol>
        <ol>Step 3: Add your mushrooms, the whites of the green onions and bamboo shoots</ol>

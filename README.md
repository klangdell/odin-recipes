# odin-recipes

These are recipes that I have made myself and want to share with others.

This is my 1st project in which I am creating my very 1st webpage from scratch.

With this project, I learned how to properly code a web html page. I learned how to use ordered lists, unordered lists, emphasizing texts, and how to put multiple links within a webpage.
